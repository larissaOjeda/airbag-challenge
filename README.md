This repo contains an flask API solution with specific requested functions 

It was designesd as a model-view-controller.

Inside Models folder you can find two folders: 
- entities: containing the structure to store caesar cipher in db 
- exercisesModel: containing all the logic of the 4 solved exercises. 

To run the project: `python3 /src/app.py`

A db was created and connected with docker (and I included the .env file to run it)
